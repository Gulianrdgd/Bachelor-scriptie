    \maketitle
    
    My thesis topic will be about Backdoor attacks on Deep neural networks. 
    My focus will be on a backdoor on speech recognition using a tone that humans
    can't hear. I will combine the work of \cite{Can} and \cite{10.1145/3081333.3081366} to create
    a backdoor attack that is only audible to a microphone and will be in the range of human hearing.
    This means that even when applying filters, to filter out the ultrasonic frequencies, the trigger will still be recorded.
    \\\\
    Backdoor attacks on deep neural networks are ways to make the deep learning 
    model behave normally when normal data is provided, but it will behave 
    differently when special poisoned data is provided. The poisoned data in my
    case will be the tone which be the result of two ultrasonic tones.
    \\\\
    This backdoor can be practically undetectable and therefore has a lot of impact.
